# LinkBlog

LinkBlog is a prototype, page archiving, link shortener using:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Plumbum](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum)

I imagine running it as a service, adding links to it via a
bookmarklet, and syncing its contents to Dropbox to make them
accessible from anywhere.
